---+!! NewUserPlugin
%TOC%
---++ Description
This plugin is of use in those cases where users are registered and authenticated externally,
for example using LDAP.
So users are not registered natively using its own registration workflow and therefore don't
have a user topic in the %USERSWEB% web.
This plugin fills that gap and creates a user's topic if it does not yet exist.

---++ Settings
You can customize the template that is used to create a new user topic
by setting the ={NewUserTemplate}= in =configure=, or by setting 
a =NEWUSERTEMPLATE= preference variable (e.g. in %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences):

   * Set NEWUSERTEMPLATE = %SYSTEMWEB%.NewLdapUserTemplate

The latter will only take effect when not specified in =configure=.
If not set, it defaults to <nop>NewUserTemplate. This plugin comes with an example template,
NewLdapUserTemplate, to illustrate how to extract user data from an LDAP directory and integrate
the information into the user's topic dynamically. You will need to install the
Foswiki:Extensions/LdapNgPlugin and the Foswiki:Extensions/GluePlugin to make use of it.


---++ Syntax
During topic creation the following variables in the <nop>NEWUSERTEMPLATE are expanded:
   * =$nop=: 
   * =%<nop>WIKINAME%=:
   * =%<nop<USERNAME%=
   * =%<nop>WIKIUSERNAME%=
   * =%<nop>EXPAND{...}%=
   * =%<nop>STARTEXPAND%= ... =%<nop>STOPEXPAND%=

To expand additional VARIABLES, you can use the =%<nop>EXPAND{}%= or =%<nop>STARTEXPAND%= ... %<nop>STOPEXPAND%=
syntax.  All percent signs have to be escaped by =$percnt=, deeper recursion levels may
use =$dollar=, too. 

Example:
<verbatim>
%EXPAND{$percntGMTIME{"$year-$mo-$day"}$percnt}%
</verbatim>
